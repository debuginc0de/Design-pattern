Create new objects by copying (cloning) an existing object,
 instead of creating from scratch.

 When to Use Prototype Pattern?
 ->
   1. Object creation is costly or complex.
   2. You want to avoid re-initialization of properties.
   3. You need many similar objects.

 Imagine a resume template (CV). Instead of creating every new resume from scratch, you:
   Open a template (prototype)
   Edit name, skills, etc.
   Save it as a new file
   Thatâ€™s the Prototype Pattern.

   # why we need Prototype Design Pattern?
   1.It eliminates the (potentially expensive) overhead of initializing an object
   2.It simplifies and can optimize
    the use case where multiple objects of the same type will have mostly the same data
   3.Original object remain unaltered, we can use clone object for use case.
